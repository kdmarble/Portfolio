                        <p>I am a self-taught web developer currently based in Clinton, NY, with a focus in front-end, React, and an interest in design. I was initially interested in computers, and further web development, when I was in middle school, and wrote my first HTML tag. It was exhilarating seeing my text turn into a tangible website. It was always something I kept as a hobby though, and I eventually pursued a degree in Exercise Science from SUNY Fredonia, graduating in December 2017.</p> <p>From there, I immediately enrolled into an online Master’s of Fitness and Wellness Leadership program through SUNY Plattsburgh, which I graduating from in May 2019. Along the way, development is something I would always pop back into, thoroughly enjoy, and put on the back burner. After graduation, I did some serious soul-searching. I had railroaded myself into a very specific career path, and after serious introspection, realized it wasn’t the fit or me. What I loved most from my time in college was the logic, problem-solving, and creativity I experienced.</p> <p>In June of 2019, I started my second Bachelor's degreee in Computer science, which I will complete in May 2021. This website serves as a place for me to highlight learning projects, assignments, and accomplishments in my journey.</p>
