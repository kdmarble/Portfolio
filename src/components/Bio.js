                        <p>I am a self-taught web developer currently based in Clinton, NY, with a focus in front-end, React, and an interest in design. I was initially interested in computers, and further web development, when I was in middle school, and wrote my first HTML tag. It was exhilarating seeing my text turn into a tangible website. It was always something I kept as a hobby though, and I eventually pursued a degree in Exercise Science from SUNY Fredonia, graduating in December 2017.</p> <p>From there, I immediately enrolled into an online Master’s of Fitness and Wellness Leadership program through SUNY Plattsburgh, of which I will be graduating from in May 2019. Along the way, web development is something I would always pop back into, thoroughly enjoy, and put on the back burner. After graduation, I did some serious soul-searching. I had railroaded myself into a very specific career path, and after serious introspection, realized it wasn’t the fit or me. What I loved most from my time in college was the logic, problem-solving, and creativity I experienced.</p> <p>In October of 2018, I decided to fully commit to becoming a web developer, and since then I have spent everyday learning, practicing, and loving the journey. There is always something new to learn, and there should always be something to strive for.</p>
